# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in JavaScript

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project serves as a great introduction to web development and JavaScript.

**Key Features:**

- Two players take turns marking "X" and "O" on a 3x3 grid.
- The game automatically detects when a player has won or if it's a draw.
- It provides a clean and user-friendly interface for an enjoyable gaming experience.

**How to Play:**

1. Players take turns clicking on an empty cell to place their symbol.
2. The game declares a winner when a player has three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.
3. If all cells are filled, and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

**Project Structure:**

- `main.html`: The HTML file that defines the game's structure.
- `main.css`: The CSS file for styling the game grid and cells.
- `main.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the game logic and user interactions.
